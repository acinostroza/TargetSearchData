\maketitle

\begin{abstract}\sf
This package contains exemplary files for the package \Biocpkg{TargetSearch}. It
includes raw NetCDF files from an {\em E. coli} salt stress experiment,
extracted peak list for each CDF file, a sample description file, a  metabolite
reference library, and a retention index marker definition file.
\end{abstract}

\section{Package Contents}

The \Biocpkg{TargetSearchData} package contains as subset of metabolite data
collected from a {\em E. coli} salt stress experiment. This was part of a stress
response study described in \cite{Jozefczuk2010}. The samples were measured in
an Agilent 6890 series GC system with a 7683 series autosampler injector coupled
to a Leco Pegasus 2 time-of-flight mass spectrometer. For further details,
please refer to said publication.

In addition, this package \textbf{only provides} a couple of simple {\em helper}
functions; these are intended to be used by \Biocpkg{TargetSearch} in its
examples. This is dicussed in the following section.

The following subsections describe each type of file in detail.

\subsection{Sample File}

Tab-delimite text file of sample metadata. This provides a list of raw
\code{CDF} files, their respective measurement day (MD), and the time point of
the salt stress experiment.  Samples with the same time point correspond to
biological replicates. Note that the time point is given in arbitrary units,
more precisely, 1 is the first sampling time, 3 is the third one, and so on.

Note that the measurement day corresponds with the first four digits of the
chromatogram file name.

\begin{File}[label=samples.txt]
      CDF_FILE   MEASUREMENT_DAY   TIME_POINT
  7235eg08.cdf              7235            1
  7235eg11.cdf              7235            1
  7235eg26.cdf              7235            1
  7235eg04.cdf              7235            3
  7235eg30.cdf              7235            3
  ...
\end{File}

\subsection{CDF files}

The \texttt{CDF} files, also known as \texttt{NetCDF}, are a trimmed down version of
the original, {\em baseline corrected}, files that were experted by {\em LECO Pegasus}
in the context of the {\em E. coli} salt stress experiment. The baseline correction
was performed by {\em LECO} using default parameters. For information on the
experiment, please refer to \cite{Jozefczuk2010}.

In particular, the retention time was bounded between 200 and 400 seconds, while the
mass-over-charge ratio ($m/z$) between 85 and 320 daltons. This was done in order to reduce
the package size.

The file names follow a systematic nomenclature: \code{ydddaann.cdf}, where \code{y}
is the last digit of the year (starting from 2000), \code{ddd} is the day of the year
(from 1 to 365), \code{aa} is an arbitrary code (originally this was connected
to a specific mass spectrometer), and \code{nn} is the measurement order of the
sample in the specified year and day. Together, the part \code{yddd} correspond
to the measurement day.

\subsection{RI files}

For each \code{CDF} file there is a corresponding retention time corrected
peak list file, the so-colled \code{RI} files. These are tab-delimited text
files containing the retention time, retention index, and spectra. Each
spectrum is a list of \emph{m/z} and intensities separated by colons (:).

The text file format is the original format used in early \Biocpkg{TargetSearch}
version. There is also a binary format which is used by default and is
designed for fast reading. These files are not part of this package, however
(see \Biocpkg{TargetSearch} documentation).

The file name convention is to prefix each \code{CDF} file with \code{RI\_}
and change the file extension from \code{cdf} to \code{txt} (or \code{dat}
for the binary format).

\subsection{Library File}

This is tab-delimited text file with the list of metabolite targets (library) to
search in the chromatograms. Each row is a metabolite, while columns are the
metabolite name, retention index (RI), time deviation (\code{Win\_1}), selective
masses (\code{SEL\_MASS}), and the metabolite spectrum.

The time deviation is specified in the first column (\code{Win\_1}) and
represents the first search window. See \Biocpkg{TargetSearch} vignette for
details.

\begin{File}[label=library.txt]
  Name            RI      Win_1  SEL_MASS             SPECTRUM
  Pyruvic acid    222767  4000   89;115;158;174;189   85:7 86:14 87:7 88:5 ...

  ...
\end{File}

\subsection{Retention Time Correction File}

This is tab-delimited text file of retention time markers. The markers are fatty acid
methyl esthers (FAME) which elute evenly distributed on the retention time dimension
and have a characteristic \emph{m/z} value.

\begin{File}[label=rimLimits.txt]
  LowerLimit UpperLimit RIstandard
         230        280     262320
         290        340     323120
         350        400     381020
\end{File}

A fourth column called \emph{Mass} can be specified if the \emph{m/z} value is
\textbf{not} the default of 87. See \Rfunction{ImportFameSettings} documentation
from \Biocpkg{TargetSearch}.

\section{Helper functions}

Simple functions are provided to return the absolute file path of the files
contained in \Biocpkg{TargetSearchData}. These function are used frequently in
\Biocpkg{TargetSearch} examples as a shorthand to function calls such as
\Rfunction{find.package()} and \Rfunction{file.path()}. The functions also
perform some basic checks internally. All these functions have a \Rfunction{tsd\_}
prefix. The following shows a brief description and examples of these functions.

The function \Rfunction{tsd\_path()} is a function to locate \Biocpkg{TargetSearchData}
installation path, where the example files are found. It's built on
\Rfunction{find.package()}.

<<f1>>==
path <- tsd_path()
path
@

The function \Rfunction{tsd\_data\_path()} returns the path where the example
files are. They are in a subdirectory called \code{gc-ms-data}, which can be
passed as argument, though this is not needed.

<<f2>>==
path <- tsd_data_path()
dir(path)
@

The function \Rfunction{tsd\_file\_path()} returns of path of one or more files
contained in the directory \code{gc-ms-data}. It takes a character vector as
argument. If the file does not exist, then it raises an error.

<<f3>>==
tsd_file_path(c('samples.txt','library.txt'))
@

Finally, the functions \Rfunction{tsd\_cdffiles} and \Rfunction{tsd\_rifiles}
return the list of \code{CDF} and \code{RI} files contained in the data path
respectively.

<<f4>>==
cdf <- tsd_cdffiles()
ri <- tsd_rifiles()
@
